# google-docs-clone

This is a simple clone of Google Docs developed with React.js, Quill.js, Socket.io and MongoDB. This is not an original project - it was created by following along with a tutorial by Web Dev Simplified on Youtube ([link to video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRaelG7v0OU&t=689s).
